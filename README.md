### This is C++ version code of [the paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S127096382031052X) 
### More codes are comming...

#### Introduction
A ROS based library to perform localization for robot swarms using Ultra Wide Band (UWB) and Inertial Measurement Unit (UWB).


#### Features:

FGO localization algorithms that integrate UWB and IMU. 
C++/ROS interface for TimeDomain UWB sensors
Least square optimization to calibrate the positions of UWB anchors
