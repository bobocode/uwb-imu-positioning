## Tightly-coupled integrated navigation system between UWB and IMU for UAV indoor localization
### This is C++ version code of the paper [Tightly coupled integrated navigation system via factor graph for UAV indoor localization](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S127096382031052X) 
### Currently it provides loosely and tightly coupled FGO integration. More codes is coming....

#### Introduction
A ROS based library to perform localization for robot swarms using Ultra Wide Band (UWB) and Inertial Measurement Unit (UWB).


#### Features
- [x] beacon positioning with only UWB.
- [x] FGO localization algorithms that integrate UWB and IMU.
- [] EKF localization algotithms that integrate UWB and IMU.
